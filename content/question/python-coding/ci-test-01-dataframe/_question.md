title: CircleCI Test 01 - Create a DataFrame
---

This is a Python question for CircleCI integration. `solution.py` and `check.py` should run **without** errors. No need to change any code when running.

This question ensures that Python code with `pandas` package can run in CircleCI.

```python
df_test1 = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2], 'b': [3, 4]})
```
