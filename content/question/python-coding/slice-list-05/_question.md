title: Slice a list
---

You are a librarian at the undergraduate library. You spot 5 students sitting side-by-side on a desk. The names of those students are stored in the `row` variable. Since they're sitting too close to one another, you want to ask Mijeong and Joshua to move to a different table 🙅‍♀️ to ensure the safety of everyone. Can you select Mijeong and Joshua using Python's slice feature with an appropriate step and save the sliced result to `please_move`? Your code should print `['Mijeong', 'Joshua']`.
