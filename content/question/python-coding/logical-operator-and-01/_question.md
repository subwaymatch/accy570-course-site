title: Six Flags Logical "And"
---

As a safety manager at Six Flags (a very popular amusement park), you want to automate the width and height requirements for a rollercoaster ride.

To ride a rollercoaster, a passenger must be at least 52 inches tall (greater than or equal to) **and** be at least 110 pounds (greater than equal to).

Can you implement the checking logic in Python code?
