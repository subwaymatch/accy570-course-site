title: Iterate over a list
---

You are given a list of prices for the items you have added to a cart. Assuming that the sales tax is a whopping 20% for all items, can you print out the after-tax price for each item ðŸ§®? For example, `[10, 20, 30]` should print `12.0`, `24.0`, `36.0` in separate lines.
