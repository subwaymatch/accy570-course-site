title: Six Flags Logical "Or"
---

As a sales manager at Six Flags (a very popular amusement park), you want to ask the customers if they'd like to purchase an annual pass **only if they don't have one**.

However, you are currently only asking the customers who already have annual passes due to a faulty logic ðŸ˜³. Can you change the code below so that you only ask the customers without an annual pass?
