title: Add net income for four quarters using a `for` loop
---

`transactions` contain the list of all transactions. Positive amounts indicate payments you have received, while negative amounts indicate expenses. You want to find out the total expense. Use a combination of a `for` loop and an `if` statement to find the sum of expenses. After your code runs, `total_expense` should be a negative number (sum of all negative transactions).
