title: Create a list of monthly income and expenses
---

You are tracking your monthly income & spending. Below is a list of items.

- Received paycheck (+7000).
- Purchased a new laptop (-2000)
- Purchased grocery items from County Market (-100)
- Paid rent (-1000)
- Paid phone bill (-50)

Create a new list `items` and store _only_ the amount of each transaction item.
