title: CircleCI Test 04 - Global variables
---

This is a Python question for CircleCI integration. `solution.py` and `check.py` should run **with** errors. This question checks whether the global variable `some_global` from `ci-test-03-global-var-test-part-a` is cleaned up before running `check.py` in here.

**CI should fail this question.**
