title: Print using the f-string
---

Given a list `names` which contains an array of names, you would like to greet everyone on the list by saying `Hello, NAME!`. Note that the actual names should replace the "NAME" inside the greeting message. Can you greet everyone using the f-string inside a `print()` function?
