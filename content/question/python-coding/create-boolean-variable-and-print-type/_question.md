title: Create a boolean variable and print type
---

First, set the value of `age` variable with your age. `age` should be an integer type (no decimals and no quotes around the value).

Then, check whether `age` is greater or equal to 16 and store the result to `can_drive`.

In case you feel lost, the code to check whether the gas price is relatively cheap is `is_gas_cheap = gallon_price <= 2`. `is_gas_cheap` will either be `True` or `False`.
