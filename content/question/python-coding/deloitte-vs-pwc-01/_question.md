Deloitte offers you $81,000 while PwC offers you $85,000. Your decision-making is solely based on the offer amount. Can you complete the code below to help you choose the right offer?

First, create two variables `deloitte_offer` and `pwc_offer`. Set the initial values to 81000 and 85000. Then, replace the missing code to compare the offers.
