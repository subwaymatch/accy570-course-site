title: Create a list of my courses
---

Create a new variable `my_courses`. `my_courses` must be of a `list` type. In `my_courses` variable, store the courses you are taking. Note that it should contain at least one item - "ACCY 570". There is no need to print `my_courses` list, although you can if you'd like.
