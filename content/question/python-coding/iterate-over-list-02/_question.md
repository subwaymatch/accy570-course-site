title: Iterate over a list
---

You are given a list of prices for the items you have added to a cart. Assuming that the sales tax is a whopping 20% for all items, can you calculate the after-tax price for each item and update `prices`? For example, if the `prices` before running your code is `[10, 20, 30]`, it should end up being `[12.0, 24.0, 36.0]`.
