---

You have opened a bank account. Create a variable named `balance` with an initial value of 0. There are three transactions listed below. For each transaction, update the `balance` variable accordingly. After completing three transactions, print out the `balance` amount using `print()`.

1. Deposit 2500 dollars (add 2500).
2. Withdraw 1400 dollars (minus 1400).
3. Deposit 600 dollars (add 600).

Don't forget to print the final `balance` amount.
