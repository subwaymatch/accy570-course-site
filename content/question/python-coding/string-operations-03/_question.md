You are given a string of a DNA sequence in the `dna` variable. Can you check whether the string `'ATTT'` is a subsequence of the `dna` string? Use the `in` operator. Store the result to a new variable named `is_subsequence`. `is_subsequence` should either be `True` if `'ATTT'` is a subsequence of `dna`, and `False` if otherwise.
