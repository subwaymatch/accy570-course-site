title: Update a customer's email
---

You decide to store your customer's email into a variable called `email`. The customer's email was initially `john@aol.com`. However, John no longer uses that email and instead uses `john@gmail.com`.

Create a variable named `email` with `john@aol.com` as the initial value. Then, update the value with `john@gmail.com`. Note that the email values should be enclosed by single quotes (') or double quotes (").
