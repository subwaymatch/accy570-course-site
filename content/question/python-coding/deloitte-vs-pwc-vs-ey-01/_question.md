On top of your two offers, you now have a new offer from Ernst & Young. EY is offering 85,000. Create a third variable named `ey_offer` with the value of 85,000. Then, complete remaining code to help you make a decision.

Your code should print `Accept PwC offer`, `Accept EY offer`, or `Accept Deloitte offer`.
