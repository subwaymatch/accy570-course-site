  What is the return value of the following function? **Hint**: Does the `print_course_number()` function have a `return` statement?

  ```python
  def print_course_number(course_number):
    print(course_number)
  ```
options:
  - "No return value[o]"
  - "`course_number`"
explanation: |
  Note that the function doesn't have a return statement. It prints out the `course_number` instead of returning it.
