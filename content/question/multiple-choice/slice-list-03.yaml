  What is the output of the following code?

  ```python
  breeds = ['Golden Retriever', 'Corgi', 'Bulldog']

  print(breeds[2:0])
  ```
options:
  - "`[]`[o]"
  - "`['Corgi', 'Bulldog']`"
  - "`['Golden Retriever', 'Corgi']`"
  - "Python throws an error"
explanation: |
  Start index is larger than the end index. Therefore, an empty list is returned.
