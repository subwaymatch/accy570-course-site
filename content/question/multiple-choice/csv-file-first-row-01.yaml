  Say I have the following data in my CSV file:

  ```
  | A | B | C |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | 2 | 3 |
  | 5 | 5 | 5 |
  | 8 | 8 | 8 |
  ```

  What will the **first row** of the CSV file be?

options:
  - "`A,B,C`[o]"
  - "`1,2,3`"
explanation: |
  The first row is the header row, which is `A,B,C`.
