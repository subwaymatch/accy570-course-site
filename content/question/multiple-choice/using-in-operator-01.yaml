  What is the output of the following code? 🐕

  ```python
  breeds = ['Golden Retriever', 'Corgi', 'Bulldog']

  print('German Shepherd' in breeds)
  ```
options:
  - '`True`'
  - '`False`[o]'
explanation: |
  `in` operator checks whether an element is in a list. Since the `breeds` list does not contain 'German Shepard', Python prints `False`.
