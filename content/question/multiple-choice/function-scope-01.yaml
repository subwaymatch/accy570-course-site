  What does the following code print? **Hint**: Do you see a `print()` statement?

  ```python
  def greet(name):
    message = f'Hello, {name}!'

  greet('Trent')
  ```
options:
  - "`Hello, Trent!`"
  - "The code runs without an error, but does not print anything.[o]"
  - "The code throws an error."
explanation: |
  The code has no call to the `print()` function. Nothing is printed.
