  What is the output of the following code?

  ```python
  t1 = [80, 120, 200, 100]

  t2 = t1.copy()
  t3 = t2
  t2[0] = 100

  print(t3[0])
  ```
options:
  - '`80`'
  - '`100`[o]'
explanation: |
  Although `t2` is a deep copy of `t1`, `t3` is a shallow copy of `t2`. `t2` and `t3` refer to the same list.
