  What is the value of `result` in the code below? **Hint**: Does the `divide_em_up()` function have a `return` statement?

  ```python
  def divide_em_up(x, y):
    print(x / y)

  result = divide_em_up(10, 2)
  ```
options:
  - "`5` (int)"
  - "`5.0` (float)"
  - "`None` (no return value)[o]"
explanation: |
  Note that the function doesn't have a return statement. The `result` will be `None`.
