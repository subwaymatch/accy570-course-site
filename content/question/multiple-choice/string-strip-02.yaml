  What does the following code output? **Hint**: This may (or may not) be a trick question ðŸ¤¡.

  ```python
  who = '   Mitch   '
  who2 = who.rstrip()

  print(who)
  ```
options:
  - "`   Mitch   `[o]"
  - "`Mitch   `"
  - "`   Mitch`"
  - "`Mitch`"
explanation: |
  While `rstrip()` removes all whitespaces from the end of a string, it does not modify the original string. In this case `who2` has the stripped result while `who` remains unchanged.
