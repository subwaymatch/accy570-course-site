  Since Python doesn't run the code inside a function until it is called, what is the output of the code below? **Hint**: At what point does the code inside the `hi()` function run?

  ```python
  def hi():
    print('Hello')

  print('Bye')
  hi()
  ```
options:
  - "`Hello`<br />`Bye`"
  - "`Bye`<br />`Hello`[o]"
explanation: |
  Although `hi()` is defined before the `print('Bye')` line, the function is executed afterwards (in the last line).
