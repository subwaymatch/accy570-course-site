  What does the following code output? **Hint**: This may (or may not) be a trick question ðŸ¤¡.

  ```python
  who = 'Geoff'
  who.lower()

  print(who)
  ```
options:
  - "`geoff`"
  - "`Geoff`[o]"
  - "`GEOFF`"
explanation: |
  Remember, `lower()` and `upper()` methods return a new string and does not modify the original string. In this case, the code is printing the original `who` string.
