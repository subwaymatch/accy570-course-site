  What does the following code output?

  ```python
  s = '!?WHAT!?'

  print(s.rstrip('?'))
  ```
options:
  - "`!WHAT!`"
  - "`!?WHAT`"
  - "`!?WHAT!`[o]"
  - "`!?WHAT!?`"
explanation: |
  Only the right-most question mark will be removed since `rstrip()` removes all matching characters from the end of a string.
