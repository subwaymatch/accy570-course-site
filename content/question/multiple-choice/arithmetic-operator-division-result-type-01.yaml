text: "You have two variables - ten with a value of 10, and four with a value of 4. Both variables are of int (integer) types. What do you think the output of print(ten / four) be? We haven't discussed this yet. Make your best guess."
options:
  - "`2.5` since Python is smart enough to conver the result to a more precise type[o]"
  - "`2` since both variables are integers"
  - "Throws an error since Python doesn't know what to do"
explanation: |
  Division of two numeric values will always yield a float type.
