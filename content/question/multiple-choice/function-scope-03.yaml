  What does the following code print?

  ```python
  park = 'Jay'

  def func():
    park = 'Mijeong'
    print(park)

  func()
  ```
options:
  - "`Jay`"
  - "`Mijeong`[o]"
  - "The code throws an error."
explanation: |
  In the first line of `func()`, a local `park` variable (that is separate from the global `park` variable) is initialized with `'Mijeong'`.
