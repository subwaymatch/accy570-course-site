  What is the output of the following code?

  ```python
  breeds = ['Golden Retriever', 'Corgi', 'Bulldog']

  print(breeds[2:2])
  ```
options:
  - "`[]`[o]"
  - "`['Corgi']`"
  - "`['Bulldog']`"
  - "Python throws an error"
explanation: |
  Since start index is same as the end index, Python will return an empty list.
