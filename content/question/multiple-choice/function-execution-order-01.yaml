  What is the output of the following code? **Hint**: Is this function called anywhere in the code?

  ```python
  def print_three():
    print(3)
  ```
options:
  - "`3`"
  - "No output[o]"
explanation: |
  The given code doesn't have a call to the function (i.e., `print_three()`). Therefore, `print(3)` is never executed.
