  What is the output of the following code?

  ```python
  covid_testing_weekdays = ['Tuesday', 'Friday']

  covid_testing_weekdays[1] = 'Monday'

  print(covid_testing_weekdays)
  ```
options:
  - "`['Monday', 'Friday']`"
  - "`['Tuesday', 'Monday']`[o]"
  - "`['Tuesday', 'Friday']`"
  - "Python throws an error."
explanation: |
  Since index 1 refers to the second item in the list, Friday will be replaced with Monday.
