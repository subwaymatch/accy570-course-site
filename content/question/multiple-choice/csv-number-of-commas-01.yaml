  Say I have the following data in my CSV file:

  ```
  | A | B | C |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | 2 | 3 |
  | 5 | 5 | 5 |
  | 8 | 8 | 8 |
  ```

  You decide to save this data as a CSV file. How many commas will be in your CSV file? In other words, if you open the CSV file in a text editor and count the commas, how many will there be?
options:
  - "3"
  - "4"
  - "8[o]"
  - "12"
explanation: |
  There are 2 commas per row * 4 rows.
