  What does the following code print?

  ```python
  park = 'Jay'

  def func():
    park = 'Mijeong'

  func()
  print(park)
  ```
options:
  - "`Jay`[o]"
  - "`Mijeong`"
  - "The code throws an error."
explanation: |
  In the first line of `func()`, a local `park` variable (that is separate from the global `park` variable) is initialized with `'Mijeong'`. However, note that the `print(park)` is executed after the `func()` has finished running. `park` refers to the global `'Jay'` in this case.
