title: You have already worked with objects ðŸŽ…
---

Consider lists (`list`) and dictionaries (`dict`) you have recently started using. Both are objects. That's why, to append an element to a list, you used the `append()` method.

```markdown
l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l1.append(17)
```

In this code, we are calling the `append()` method that belongs to the `list` object. We're telling the list to execute a behavior. In the upcoming part, we'll discuss methods that belong to the `str` object.

Remember, methods are functions too. ðŸŽ© They are just called differently than ordinary functions. We will see more objects this semester (e.g., `DataFrame`s).
