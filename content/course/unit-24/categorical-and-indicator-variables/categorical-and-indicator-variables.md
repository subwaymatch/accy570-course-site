title: Categorical and Indicator variables ðŸ”®
---

- Sometimes, you have a variable that takes on a few discrete values.
- This type of variable is called _categorical_.
- If the variable can only take on two values, it is called an _indicator_ variable.
  - In stats packages, indicator variables **_must_** have the values 0 and 1.
  - You can always map 0 and 1 to your values.
