title: What is a histogram ðŸ“Š
---

A histogram is a kind of a bar chart, but with two specific features:

1. The height of the bars represent frequency.
2. Instead of each bar representing a different category, each bar represents a bin (which is a range of numbers).

- A histogram tells you the distribution or shape of your data.
- It tells you the probability of getting a number if you choose randomly.
- Potential usage in accounting:
  - (Audit) Transaction sizes: in which ranges do your client's transactions fall? Where are the outliers?
  - (Tax) What are effective tax rates for US companies?
