title: What is a box plot ðŸŸ©
---

A box plot shows the ranges of the data and breaks the data into _quartiles_.

What is a _quartile_?

- If you put data in order based on value, a quartile is one quarter of your data.
- First quartile: the minimum value to the 25th percentile of the data
- Second quartile: 25th percentile of the data to the median (i.e., the middle-most number in the ordered data)
- Third quartile: the median to the 75th percentile of the data
- Fourth quartile: the 75th percentile of the data to the maximum value
- Q1, Q2, and Q3 are the names for the separation between each quartile.
- Q1 is the 25th percentile value, Q2 is the 50th percentile value, and Q3 is the 75th percentile value.
