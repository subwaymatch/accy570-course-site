title: Built-in functions ðŸ§±
---

Python comes with a handful of built-in functions. Have we used them? Yes! ðŸ‘½ These are referred to as Python's "standard library". `print()`, `abs()`, `max()`, `min()`, `int()`, `float()`, `bool()`, `str()` are all part of Python's standard library.

```python
best_score = max(65, 99, 87)
print(best_score)
# Prints 99
```
