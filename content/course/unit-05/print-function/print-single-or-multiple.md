title: Print single or multiple values
---

`print()` function is frequently used to print out some text and values. It's a super-useful tool.

So far, we've mostly used it to print out a single value or a variable.

```python
# Printing out a single value
print(-17.4)    # -17.4

x = 19
print(x)        # 19
```

We can use it to print out multiple values or variables.

```python
x = 19
print(x, True, 'hello')   # 19 True Hello
```
