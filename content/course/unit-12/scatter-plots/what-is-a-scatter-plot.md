title: What is a scatter plot? ðŸ¦š
---

- A scatter plot is a set of points plotted on a horizontal and vertical axis (also called an
  x-axis and a y-axis).
- Scatter plots use two continuous or discrete variables (i.e., an `x` variable and a `y` variable).

When do we use a scatter plot?

- Scatter plots are useful when you want to understand the **relationship between two variables** (e.g., correlations).
- Scatter plots provide information about the **density of observations** that fall in a particular area.
