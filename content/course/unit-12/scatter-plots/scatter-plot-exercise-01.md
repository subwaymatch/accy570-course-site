**Business Question**: Earlier, we saw how the operating income and operating cash flows moved over time for a few companies (Enron and its competitors). Is there a relationship between operating income and operating cash flows for companies in general?

Use the `2017Operating Income vs. Operating CF.xlsx` excel file to create a scatter plot using operating cash flows and operating income as the x and y axes.

**Variable definitions**:

- `OANCF`: operating cash flows
- `OIADP`: operating income after depreciation
- `AT`: total assets
- `GVKEY`: company identifier
- `FYEAR`: fiscal year
