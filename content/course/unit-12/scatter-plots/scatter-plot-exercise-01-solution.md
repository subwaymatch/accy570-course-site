Open up Tableau.

Drag `2017Operating Income vs. Operating CF.xlsx` file into the Tableau window. Once you see the data, click on "Sheet 1" at the bottom.

Drag `Oancf` into the "Columns" pane and drag `Oiadp` into the "Rows" pane. You should see a single circular mark.

![https://accy570-fa2020-course-site-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/scatter-tableau-07-drag-x-and-y-variables.png](https://accy570-fa2020-course-site-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/scatter-tableau-07-drag-x-and-y-variables.png)

Click on `SUM(0ancf)` in the "Columns" pane and convert it to a dimension. This tells Tableau to treat each value separately instead of aggregating it.

Repeat the process for `SUM(Oiadp)`. Click on `SUM(Oiadp)` in the "Rows" pane and convert it to a dimension. Again, this tells Tableau to draw a mark for each value.

You should now be able to see the scatter plot.

You can add a trend line to see the correlation between the two variables. Right-click on the scatter plot and select "Trend Lines" - "Show Trend Lines".

Our final result:
