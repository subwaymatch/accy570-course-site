A Python variable can contain any type of data. So far, we have seen number types (both integers, decimals) and text types (also known as "string").

```
# Integer
course_number = 570

# Float (decimal)
big_mac_price = 3.99

# Strings (text)
# Both single quotes and double quotes can be used for strings.
greeting = 'Greetings!'
greeting2 = "Greetings!"
```

What happens when you want to contain multiple items into a single variable? You can use the `list` type. A list can contain multiple values separated by commas. To denote a list, wrap the values with square brackets - "[" and "]".

```
# Create a list of offers you receive
offers = ['KPMG', 'EY', 'Deloitte', 'PwC']

print(offers) # Prints ['KPMG', 'EY', 'Deloitte', 'PwC']
```
