There are a few rules when naming variables.

- They can contain alphabets (both uppercase A-Z and lowercase a-z).
- They can contain digits (0-9).
- They can contain underscore characters (\_).
- Variable names **cannot** contain spaces.
- Variable names **cannot** contain other special characters.
- Variable names **cannot** begin with a digit.
- Variable names are case sensitive. - `myvar`, `myVar`, `MyVar`, and `MYVAR` are all different variables.
