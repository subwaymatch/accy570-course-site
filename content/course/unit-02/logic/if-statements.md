As seen in the previous page, `if` statements works as follows:

```python
if condition is true:
  take some action
```

But this is limited. What if you want to take a different action when the condition is false? Let's rewrite our logic to accomodate this.

```python
if condition is true:
  take action X
if condition is false:
  take action Y
```
