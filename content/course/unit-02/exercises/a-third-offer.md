You're a superstar and get an offer from a third firm, Ernst & Young!

![Another Offer](https://accy570-fa2020-course-site-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/deloitte-vs-pwc-vs-ey.jpg)

- All three offers are in the same city and you like all three firms equally.
- You will choose the job with the highest starting salary.
- None of the three starting salaries are exactly equal.

Write some logic, using an if-elif-else statement, that implements your preferences.

**Hints:**

- Think about all possible orderings of the offers.
- Create a new variable, ey_offer that contains the Ernst & Young offer amount.
- Use more than one condition in your if and elif statements.
- Separate conditions with the word `and`
