A `for` loop is like a `while` loop. But it automatically keeps track of the number of times that the loop has executed. In general, you can use a `for` loop when you know exactly how many times something should execute.

A for loop tells Python to repeat a task a fixed number of times. The most common use cases are:

1. You are iterating over a list (or other list-like data).
2. You want to perform a task a fixed number of times.
