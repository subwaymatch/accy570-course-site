title: Heat map using shapes ðŸŸª

Some heat maps use shape size instead of colors. Shape size represents values. Larger shapes are larger values. Below is an example of a heat map using square shapes.

**When do we use a heat map?** ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

- A heat map is used for comparisons when you have more than one variable.
- Heat maps use two variables as the plot (like an x and y-axis) and one variable as the values (like z-axis).
