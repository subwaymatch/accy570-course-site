**Business Question**: What are the most common audit opinions for each industry?

- Use the `audit-opinion.xlsx` excel file to create the heat map with shapes. This file has the audit options for companies during 2002 and 2003.
- `Industry` is our columns.
- `Audit Opinion` is our rows.
- `LA traffic-collision-data-from- (Count)` (you may see `Number of Records` if you use an older version of Tableau) determines the size of our shape.
