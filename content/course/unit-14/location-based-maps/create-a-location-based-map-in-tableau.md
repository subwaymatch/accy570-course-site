- Select the location variable and the variable that determines the shading (use `Ctrl` on Windows or `Cmd` on Mac to select both variables).
- Select the location-based map on the "Show Me" tab.

**Business Question**: How many charities are in each state in the contiguous U.S. (excluding Alaska and Hawaii)?

Together, let's create a location-based map using the `us-charities.csv` file.

Drag `us-charities.csv` into the Tableau window. Switch to "Sheet 1".

Select `State` and `us-charities.csv (Count)` together (using `Ctrl` in Windows or `Cmd` on a Mac).

Once `State` and `us-charities.csv (Count)` are selected, open up the "Show Me" menu and Select **"maps"** (2nd option on the 2nd row).

You should now see a location-based map üå∞!

Since we don't want Alaska and Hawaii to be included on our map (we still ‚ù§Ô∏è Alaska & Hawaii), let's filter those two states out. Click on the "State" dropdown button in the "Marks" pane and select "Filter...".

Uncheck `AK`.

Find and uncheck `HI`. Click on "OK".

The map is now zoomed in without Alaska and Hawaii.

Finally, let's add some text labels to make our visualization more readable. Drag `us-charities.csv (Count)` into the "Label" box inside the "Marks" pane.
