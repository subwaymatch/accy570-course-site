In the previous page, we've stored values into _variables_. Once you create a variable, you can store a value. You can also update a variable as many times as you want. Take a look at the sample code below.

```
distance = 0

# You've traveled 40 miles, what's the total distance?
distance = distance + 40

# You've traveled another 50 miles, what's the total distance?
distance = distance + 50

# Finally, you've traveled another 10 miles!
distance = distance + 10
```

It first creates a _variable_ named `distance`. As you travel, you can track the total distance traveled by updating the `distance` variable.
