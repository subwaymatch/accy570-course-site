title: Comparing two offers

Thanks to your amazing data analytics skills, you get two job offers.

- One is from Deloitte and the other is from PwC.
- Both offers are for the Chicago offices of those firms.
- You like the firms equally, so you decide that you will take the higher offer (i.e. the one that has a higher starting salary).
- For now, assume the offers cannot be exactly equal.

I will first create two _variables_ (`deloitte_offer` and `pwc_offer`). We'll learn about those later.

```
deloitte_offer = 81000
pwc_offer = 85000
```

Your code structure would look like below.

```
if Deloitte offer is higher than PwC offer:
    take Deloitte offer
else:
    take PwC offer
```
