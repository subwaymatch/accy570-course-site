title: Goals of this course
---

The goal of this course isn't to make you into a programmer. This is not a programming course although we will heavily use the Python programming language. My biggest goal is to **spread the joy** of solving problems using data.

Programming can be painful. But it can be one of the most enjoyable things in life. Same goes for data analytics. It can be challenging, but if you enjoy solving problems, you're at the right place. I hope we find that moment together through this course.
