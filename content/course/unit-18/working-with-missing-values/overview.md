So far, we have only used datasets where there are no missing values (blank cells). However, missing values are a fact of life. You need to learn to deal with them. ðŸ¤¯

- Usually, Pandas will fill in missing values with the NumPy constant `NaN`, which stands for "not a number".
- Sometimes, you will see Python's `None`.
- Sometimes, you will see an empty string for string columns.
- For now, let's just work with `NaN`.
