1. Load the dataset into `df_admission`.
2. Filter the data so that you only have rows with `University Rating` equal to `1`.
   1. For the filtered dataset, compute the average probability of admission by running the command `df_admission['Chance of Admit'].mean()`.
   2. Repeat for University Ratings of `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`.
3. Filter the data so that you get applicants with a perfect GRE score (`340`), perfect SOP (`5`), and perfect LOR ratings (`5`).
   1. How many applicants meet these criteria?
   2. What is the average university rating for these people?
   3. What is the average chance of admission for these people?
