title: Working with a subset of your data ✂️
---

Very often, you will want to work with a subset of your data.

- Some data is invalid or irrelevant.
- You are only interested in some observations (e.g., the most recent year).

**Selecting and filtering data**

- **_Select_** means to choose specific columns or rows.
- **_Filter_** means to let some items through, but not others.
  - For example, an air filter or a water filter.
- In data analysis, _select_ and _filter_ are basically synonyms.
- Typically, I use **_select_** when I'm choosing **certain columns**.
- I use **_filter_** when I'm extracting **certain rows** based on some conditions.
