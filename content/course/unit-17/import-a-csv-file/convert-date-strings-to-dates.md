title: Converting date strings to dates ğŸ“…

- Working with dates can be a giant pain. ğŸ‘º
- If the date string is nicely formatted, _this_ can be easy.
- Sometimes, you must tell Pandas exactly what you want.
  - For example, if a date column uses `1/3/2017` for March 1st, Pandas will make an incorrect guess and assume it is January 3rd.
