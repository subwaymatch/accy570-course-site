Importing a CSV file is very similar to importing an Excel file. **Everything we have used in the previous part applies!**

- Instead of `pd.read_excel()`, we use `pd.read_csv()`.
- Since a CSV file cannot contain multiple worksheets, there is no parameter to select a specific worksheet.
- Remember delimiters? A delimiter is used to separate the data fields. You can tell `pd.read_csv()` what the delimiter in your text file is.
- `pd.read_csv()` is a super-useful function! ðŸ›¸
