Loading data seems trivial, right? When you load data, your software must convert the data into a format it understands. While data analysis software often automates this, you'll need to tell it _precisely_ what you want.

Today, we discuss how we can load data into a `DataFrame`. Common data sources include:

- Excel
- CSV files
- Databases

Go to the terminal or command line where you would open up JupyterLab (Anaconda Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac). Type in the following command:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge xlrd xlsxwriter openpyxl
```
