title: Pandas DataFrame vs Excel Worksheets ðŸ¥ž
---

`DataFrame`s are analogous to Excel worksheets.

**Similarities:**

- Rows and columns have labels (think about cell addresses in Excel - e.g., cell C7).
- You can view, add, modify, delete, filter, or run analyses on data.

**Differences:**

- A Pandas `DataFrame` must contain a contiguous block of data.
- An Excel worksheet can contain pivot tables, charts, or other embeddings. A Pandas `DataFrame` is just a single table of data.
