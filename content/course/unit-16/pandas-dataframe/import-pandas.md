title: Importing Pandas üçë
---

For the rest of this class (and in ACCY 575), you'll probably need the following import statements in every Jupyter notebook:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

Most people use `pd` as an alias for `pandas` and `np` for `numpy`. When you search online, you'll see these aliases most of the time.

Pandas is built on top of the numerical analysis library NumPy, so you'll often need functions and constants from NumPy. Just add the two lines of import statements on the code cell above to every Jupyter notebook to make your life easier.
