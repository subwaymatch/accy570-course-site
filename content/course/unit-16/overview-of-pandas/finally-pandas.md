`pandas` 🐼 is **_the_** library for working with datasets. It was originally developed for working with finance data (by Wes McKinney while working at AQR Capital Management 🏦).

Why is it so popular?

- Data manipulation becomes easy.
- It's fast. This makes huge difference when working with a large dataset (compared to Excel).
- **It's easy to reproduce and audit your work. 🕵️**
