- If you don't specify column names, the columns are labeled 0, 1, 2, ...
- This isn't useful.
- Typically, each variable in your dataset will have a name or a label, and you should use that.
- There are multiple ways to change column labels in Pandas. We'll show you two.
  - Passing a list of new column names.
  - Using the rename method.
