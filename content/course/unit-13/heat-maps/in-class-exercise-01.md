**Business Question**: What day of the month do most kickstarter projects make their deadline? Create a highlight table. You will use the dimension Deadline. Each row should be the day of the Deadline (1, 2, â€¦, 31). Each column should be the year of the Deadline. The value represented by shading should be the number of kickstarter projects (or number of records).

Use the `Kickstarter Projects through 2016.xlsx` file to create the highlighted table.
