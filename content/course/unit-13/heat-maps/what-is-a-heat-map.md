title: What is a heat map? ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
---

A heat map in its most basic form is a matrix that is shaded or colored. A matrix is a grid created using two variables: one variable makes the rows and the other variable makes the columns.

The shading or coloring is determined by the value of the cell in the matrix.

**When do we use heat maps?**

- A heat map is used for comparisons when you have more than one variable.
- A heat map can visualize any patterns between two variables.

There are different types of heat maps that we will discuss:

- Highlight Table (today)
- Heat Map using shapes (next class)
