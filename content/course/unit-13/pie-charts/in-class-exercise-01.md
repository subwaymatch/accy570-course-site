**Business Question**: Of the fortune 500 companies, what proportion of companies are audited by each auditing firm (e.g., EY, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, Grant Thornton, BDO, etc.)?

Use the `Fortune500Auditor.xlsx` excel file to create a pie chart to answer the business question above.

- Create a pie chart in Tableau.
- Each slice in the pie should represent an auditing firm (e.g., EY, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, Grant Thornton, BDO, etc.).
- Add a label of `Auditor Name`.
- Add another label that displays the number of firms that were audited by each auditing firm. As an example, PwC audited 154 companies out of the Fortune 500. The label should display 154.
