title: What is a pivot table? ðŸ“‰
---

Often you have data that you want to summarize. For example:

- Say you have one row per customer order. You want to know the total revenue by a customer.
- Say you have one row per company, and that row contains the company's auditor. What is the market share of each auditing firm?

In a situation like this, use a Pivot Table. A Pivot Table is used to summarize, sort, group, count, sum, or average data stored in a tabular data.

Pivot Tables are used _very_ commonly and your employer will love you if you're good at using pivot tables ðŸ’Ž.
