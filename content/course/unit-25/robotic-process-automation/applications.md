Audits include many manual and repetitive tasks that are appropriate for RPA.

- Loading client data into analytics tools
- Creating audit-ready work papers
- Performing sampling and confirmations
- Performing specific audit steps (e.g., reconciliation, analytical procedures, internal control testing).

Tax preparation and compliance are well-suited for RPA because many of the tasks are rule-based and repeatable.

- Data collection and manipulation
- Support work paper development
- Calculations and form production
- Review and analysis
- Audit-ready file creation
- Retention and rollover
- Filing and e-Filing
