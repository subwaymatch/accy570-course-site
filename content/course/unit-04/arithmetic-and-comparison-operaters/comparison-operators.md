Comparison operators are used to compare two values. We have already been using these operators throughout the past few lectures. To recap, here are the 6 comparison operators.

- `>`: Greather than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
- `<`: Less than
- `<=`: Less than or equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `==`: Equals

The result of a comparison operation is always a Boolean (`True` or `False`).

```python
3 < 5     # True
3 > 5     # False
10 != 11  # True
10 == 11  # False
10 == 10  # True
10 != 10  # False
```
