title: Printing with "f-strings"
---

Use `str()` function.

This one is straightforward and is the easiest conversion. Basically, everything converts to a string as you would expect.

```python
# Prints -55
# Be aware that str(-55) returns a string type
print(str(-55))

# Prints 3.1415
# Be aware that str(3.1415) returns a string type
print(str(3.1415))

# Prints True
print(str(True))
```
