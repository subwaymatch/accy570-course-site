title: Converting between types
---

Often, you will find it necessary to convert your data from one data type to another.

- You may load "dirty" data as strings and need to convert them to numbers.
- You want to print some data in a report and need to convert numbers to a formatted string.
- Sometimes, Python will automatically convert your data. You need to understand when this will happen and how it works.
  - Example: Dividing an integer by another. Python will automatically convert the result to a float.
  - Example: You accidentally use an integer as a boolean condition. Python will convert it into a boolean type.
