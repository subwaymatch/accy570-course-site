**Files 🗄️**

- Two types of storage: temporary (RAM) vs permanent (hard drive)
- When you "save" data for later use, you store the data in a file.
- The file extension tells you the file type, e.g., `.txt`, `.xlsx`, `.docx`.
- Two ways of storing data in files: text files (`.txt`, `.csv`) and binary files (Excel `.xlsx`, Word `.docx`, Tableau `.twbx`, `.exe`).

**Folders (aka directories) 📁**

- Most computers have hundreds of thousands of files stored on one or more drives.
- To organize files, computers have "file systems".
- Folders can contain other folders (subdirectories).
- The words "directory" and "folder" are synonyms (technically, there are differences - but not for the purpose of this course).
