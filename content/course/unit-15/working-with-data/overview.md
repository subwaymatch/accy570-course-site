---

Today, we begin a new unit 🦕! The new unit is designed around two tasks - loading & cleaning data.

Most people who work with data spend a large amount of their time on loading and cleaning. 👿 Why do people spend so much time loading and cleaning data?

- **Formatting ☘️**: Software for analyzing data has requirements. Data needs to be in a certain format with specific data types.
- **"Dirty" Data 🐡**: Most of the times, you get "dirty" data to begin with.
- **Human Errors 🌬**: People typing data into spreadsheets make mistakes.
- **Unstructured Data 🌊**: Text, Images, PDF files, etc.
