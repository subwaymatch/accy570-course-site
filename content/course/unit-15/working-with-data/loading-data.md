- CSV files (`.csv`)
- Databases

**Common software for data analysis:**

The software you use will often automate the process of importing the data. **However, lots of data are dirty.** Your task is to learn and clean them! 🧹

Imagine you are given a column of dates. The first few dates are:

- `5/4/2017`
- `3/9/2017`
- `12/1/2017`

This is ambiguous. Why? You don't know whether the dates are in MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY. How do you handle this? 🕵🏻‍♀️ Look through every value until you find a value that can only be one format (e.g., 13/12/2017).
