- A CSV file is a **text file** and is commonly used to store data.
- CSV files have a simple format and are **platform-independent** (i.e., easy to transfer between Windows, Mac, Linux, etc).
  - Most data analysis and statistical software can read and write CSV.
  - It's easy to save data from a database to CSV, and vice versa.
