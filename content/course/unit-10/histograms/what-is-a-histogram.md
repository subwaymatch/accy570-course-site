title: What is a histogram ðŸ“Š
---

A histogram looks like a bar chart, but with two specific features:

1. The height of the bars represent frequency.
2. Instead of each bar representing a different category, each bar represents a bin (which is a range of numbers).

**Exercise**: Create a histogram with 3 bins and a histogram with 6 bins.

Normally, we would do an exercise of creating a histogram by hand. We'll skip for now.

```python
employee_ages = [43, 44, 46, 33, 31, 47, 52, 50, 40, 40, 41, 46, 42, 37, 39, 33, 43, 46, 55, 36, 37, 43, 42, 57, 61, 47, 49, 41]
```
