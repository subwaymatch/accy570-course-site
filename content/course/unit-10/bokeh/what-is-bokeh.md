There are many visualization libraries in Python with advantages and disadvantages. Bokeh will help you gain a deeper understanding of how visualizations are created.

To use Bokeh in a notebook, you need to run these three lines of code:

```python
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
from bokeh.io import output_notebook
output_notebook()
```
