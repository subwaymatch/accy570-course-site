title: What is Tableau? ðŸ“ˆ
---

Tableau is an interactive data visualization software.

- It does not require programming (although you can).
- You can drag and drop variables into the visualization.
- This makes creating visualizations easy.
- **But**, it is also easy to create a visualization that is not what you inteded.

| Very easy to make some graphs.                  | You may not understand what you're getting.                          |
| Graphs are "pretty".                            | It's like a "black box". It does a lot of things without telling me. |
| Great hierarchy (Worksheet > Dashboard > Info). | Sometimes, simplest things are ridiculously difficulty.              |
|                                                 | Documentation is difficult to read.                                  |

- Many employers use it and love it. They want new hires to know it.
- Knowing Tableau will increase your market value.
- On the job, you are more likely to use Tableau and Excel to make graphs than anything else.
