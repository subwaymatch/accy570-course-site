Strings are used to store text data. As programmers, you should automatically think of text data when you hear the word "string".

- To create a string, enclose data in **either** single quotes (') **or** double quotes (").
- **Anything** inside the quotes are treated as text. This includes spaces and numbers.

```python
name = "Jay Chou"
favorite_dessert = "Gulab Jamun"

# "3144" is a string - ANYTHING inside quotes are treated as text
license_plate = "3144"
```
