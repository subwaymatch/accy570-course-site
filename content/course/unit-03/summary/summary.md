Control flow is the order in which statements are executed in a program. `if`, `while` loops, `for` loops are all used to control the flow of your program.

Your control flow should be logically correct.

- What is the objective of your program?
- What are valid inputs?
- Do you get the desired outputs for _every_ valid input?
- Importance of testing and test cases

Where can we use control flow mechanisms? **_Everywhere_**! I dare you to find one program that does not use control flows. Below are two examples that can utilize the control flow mechanisms we've learned.

- Flagging possibly fraudulent values (filtering)
- Transforming a column
