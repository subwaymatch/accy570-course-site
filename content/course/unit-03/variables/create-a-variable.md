We briefly went over variables last time. Let's revisit the idea. A variable is a container for any type of data.

Your Python program runs in an _environment_. An _environment_ is a _container_ for all your variables. You can think of an environment to be the _state_ of your programming environment. The _state_ of your programming language environment is a list of all your variables and their values.

Creating a variable is super easy in Python. First, you name the variable on the left side. It is followed by an equal sign (`=`). Finally, place the value on the right side of the equal sign.

```python
# name of the variable on left, than an equal sign, then the value
cash = 100
```
