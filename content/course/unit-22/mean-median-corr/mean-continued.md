title: Mean (Continued) ðŸ¦˜

This time, I'll create a histogram of all U.S. companies in 2018 (`compustat.xlsx` file).

Let's add a filter to display the companies with less than \$10 billion in revenue.

Notice that the distribution is not symmetric even if we exclude outliers.

- For companies with less than $10 billion in revenue, the mean revenue is $1.31 billion.
- Mean in Compustat dataset may not be meaningful since the distribution has a long tail.
