title: Standard Deviation ðŸ¦•
---

- Variance is a measure of "spread" in the data.
- If you have \\(n\\) data points, \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\), their variance is:

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2} {n}$$

- Since variance squares the values, the units are difficult to work with.
  - For example, the variance of our revenue data would have units of dollars squared.
- Therefore, many people report standard deviation, which is the square root of variance.
