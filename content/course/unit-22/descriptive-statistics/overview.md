Keep in mind that we are barely scratching the surface. There's so much more to data analysis. But, we'll leave those black boxes for ACCY 575.

- Some employees are paid more than others.
- What is the mean salary?
- If there are \(a \ne 0\) employees, and the salary of $i$-th employee is $x_{i}$:

\(a \ne 0\)

$$\mu = {\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_i}{n}}$$

- The mean is a useful statistic and is reported very often.
- However...
  - It's not always "in the middle" of the distribution.
  - It's very susceptible to outliers.
