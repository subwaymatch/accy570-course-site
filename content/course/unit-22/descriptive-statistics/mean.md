title: Mean (Average)
---

First, let's create a histogram of all employees' annual salaries (`chicago-payroll.csv` file).

- Some employees are paid more than others.
- What is the mean salary?
- If there are \\(n\\) employees, and the salary of \\(i\\)-th employee is \\(x\_{i}\\):

$$\mu = {\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_i}{n}}$$

- The mean is a useful statistic and is reported very often.
- However...
  - It's not always "in the middle" of the distribution.
  - It's very susceptible to outliers.
